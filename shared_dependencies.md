1. "EventObserver.js" and "LocationObserver.js": These two files are likely to share a common class or function structure for creating observers. They might also share some utility functions or constants.

2. "main.js": This file will likely import and use the classes or functions defined in "EventObserver.js" and "LocationObserver.js". It might also share some global variables or constants with these files.

3. "index.html": This file will include "main.js" and possibly "EventObserver.js" and "LocationObserver.js" as script tags. It will also contain the DOM elements that the event listeners in "EventObserver.js" and "LocationObserver.js" will attach to. The id names of these DOM elements will be shared between "index.html" and the JavaScript files.

4. Event Names: The event names such as 'click' or 'change' will be shared between "EventObserver.js", "LocationObserver.js", and "main.js".

5. Function Names: The function names for the event handlers and the observer creation functions will be shared between "EventObserver.js", "LocationObserver.js", and "main.js".

6. Message Names: If the observers or event handlers emit messages, the names of these messages will be shared between "EventObserver.js", "LocationObserver.js", and "main.js".

7. Data Schemas: If the observers or event handlers use or produce data with a specific schema, this schema will be shared between "EventObserver.js", "LocationObserver.js", and "main.js".
